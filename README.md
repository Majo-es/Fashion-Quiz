# Fashion-Quiz
- This Python script creates a fashion quiz game that presents users with five multiple-choice questions about fashion history. 
- The questions are drawn from a tuple of questions, and the corresponding options are provided in a 2D tuple.
- Users are prompted to enter their answers (A, B, C, or D), and their responses are compared to the correct answers stored in a separate tuple.
